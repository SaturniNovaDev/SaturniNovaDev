## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Peter Vega and I'm a young developer from Venezuela.
I have a special talent for computer programming, WebPage constructing and graphic design.

## Here are some basic facts about me:
ðŸŸ¦ Pronouns: He / him

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on a variety of projects, including:
- _[Semafix](https://github.com/SaturniNovaDev/Semafix)_, a software that controls traffic automatically
- _Vertex Engine_, a videogame engine with various advanced features

  And more to come!

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning many languages, including Python, JavaScript, C and C++.

ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on projects that need user feedback and/or early development testing.

âš¡ Fun fact: I started programming when I was 11 years old.

The most important thing I look for when building an app is that it does not require any additional libraries
and is ready to use out of the box.
